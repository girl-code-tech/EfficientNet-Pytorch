# EfficientNet-Pytorch

### Scalling
It is done to improve the accuracy of the model to beat the state of the art existing models and ultimately improve the efficiency of the model.

### Scalling in the Context of CNN
3 Scalling dimensions are there in CNN, Depth(Number of layers in Neural Network), Width(Number of Channels in Convolution Layer), Resolution(the image resolution passed to a CNN)
